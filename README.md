# A mini game made in java as a part of college assignment where we had to develop the game from three given classes 


       -It is a multiplayer game where Monster will have a slight advantage in power whereas Protagonist will have a slight advantage with stamina located at different positions initially.
       -At the start of game players will be asked about how many chances they want to complete the game.
       -At each chance monster and protagonist will have to decide about how much they want to move in left,right,top,bottom and their staminas will reduce accordingly.
       -Also they have to decide about the attack power of weapon.
       -If there paths coincide they will have a fight in which they can attack at each other equal number of times in which the attack of contestant having more power can reduce the health of opposition twice as of contestant with less power.
       -Their health will reduce according to the value per attack they decided.
       -There are stamina and power packets at different positions in grid for contestants.
       -If health of the player becomes negative he will lose.
       -Stamina plays a vital role because if your stamina goes in negative you will lose your health in every motion.
       -For every motion contestant can use power as well as stamina(implemented using function overloading).
